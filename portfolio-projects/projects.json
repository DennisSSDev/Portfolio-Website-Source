        "Desc": "A 3D Quantum Computer Puzzle/Adventure Game where the player explores the inner mechanics of Quantum Physics. I developed the AI of the Quants floating around as well as the combat/movement of the player. I utilized Behavior Trees for the AI, that allowed me to create cheap and fun AI. For the combat I developed the dash, jump and strike features of the player which caused Physical Simulations on impact for both the AI and player. Projectiles, collision avoidance and particle effects were also developed by me.",
