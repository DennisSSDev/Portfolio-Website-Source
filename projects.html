            <p>
              For the majority of the projects we would use visual scripting that is built into Unreal Engine, as it
              was a convinient way for both artists and
              computer science developers to get their foot in the door of game development. I made sure that they got
              all the basic concept of coding,
              but also I got the chance to teach them a couple of data structrures like Lists, Graphs and doubly linked
              list. These data structures were applied in C++.
            </p>
            <h4> Creative Design </h4>
            <img src="ue4_proj/lvl.jpg" alt="in editor image" class="responsive-img modal_img">
            <p>
              On the side I taught developers how to make good level design and utilize the concepts of immersion. The
              levels ranged from 2D side-scroller games, to 3D Dungeon Crawlers.
              We utilized Photoshop and Maya 3D a lot for prop development and animation. I helped students grasp the
              principles of modeling and creating normal maps for creating illusions of High Poly.

            <h4>The Algorithm</h4>
            <img src="tool_proj/tool_1.jpg" alt="Perlin_2d" class="responsive-img modal_img">
            <p>At the core of the project I utilize the built in Perlin function that is being adjusted by a couple of
              parameters like octaves and lacunarity that distribute the noise
              to look more natural. On the image above you can see how I project the algorithm's graphical output to a
              2D image plane.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Options</h4>
            <img src="tool_proj/tool_2.jpg" alt="Options_View" class="responsive-img modal_img">
            <p>The plug-in was optimized in a way that you could apply the algorithm to any 3D primitive object and the
              output would still result in a realistic landscape around the object.
              So if you ever wanted to create a sphere with landscape, this is would be the plug-in for you.
            </p>
            <h4>Optimization</h4>
            <img src="tool_proj/tool_3.jpg" alt="3D_View" class="responsive-img modal_img">
            <p>The plug-in has 3 methods of generating terrain: 2D with no colors applied, 2D with colors, and 3D
              landmass projection. The 3D mode has
              specific options that would allow you to specify the amount of triangles you want the land to have, thus
              allowing the user to save extra memory and processing power.
              Together with Nvidia's HLSL Graphics, I've been able to decrease the amount of necessary triangles and
              add a special style to the terrain that, again,
              could be adjusted in the editor easily.
            </p>
            <h4>Menu Bar</h4>
            <img src="tool_proj/tool_4.jpg" alt="Menu View" class="responsive-img modal_img">
            <p>Witht the help of the menu the user can easily switch any settings of the plug-in that
              would suit any types of terrain. You can also switch the biomes around and mix and mash between them to
              see what works best for you.

          <h4>How the server communicates</h4>
          <img src="net_proj/Network1.jpg" alt="Server_Code" class="left responsive-img modal_img">
          <img src="net_proj/Network2.jpg" alt="Client_Code" class="right responsive-img modal_img">
          <p>I utilized Unity's low level Network API to establish the connection between the user and the server.
            Currently, the way it works is when the server is online it will be searching for any incoming packages
            that
            include a ConnectEvent. In the case of that happening the server will start sending information to all the
            users currently connected regarding the newly connected member and will update the total
            list of players in the level. After the established connection the server will try to ask for player
            locations and if the player replies back it will update the location of that player to the rest of the
            party.
            Ofcourse, since the messages for the locations are going to go through the unreliable channel, occasionally
            there could be a lag spike, but it is not as important as the rest of the information, that goes
            through the reliable channel. Currently the server itself doesn't lerp player locations, but it uses the
            Unity's built in mechanic for lerping player locations over multiplayer. After the player disconnects from
            the level
            the server will remove him from the list, but will leave a binary file regarding the player's previous
            connection.

            <p>The game is similar to how Geometry Wars works where the player will be constantly attacked by
              projectiles from around the level. Since the projectiles wrap around the
              level and they spawn 2 child projectiles that fly even faster, the player should be very careful in how
              he manuevers the area around and should think which projectile should he
              destroy next. There is also a multiplayer mode where both players compete between each other for how many
              projectiles they destroyed, but also bumping each other into asteroids
              to win some time.</p>

            <h4>Game design</h4>
            <img src="hack_proj/bugs.jpg" alt="game_play" class="responsive-img modal_img">
            <p>This was my first game where I tried to implement Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm. Due to the theme of
              computer bugs, it was a legidimate attempt to add the bugs a way to constantly
              be able to catch yup to the player, avoid all block that the player could put with the level editor. But
              at the same time, I gave the player many ways to stage off the attacks with
              high gun fire rate and power ups, which included a large scale explosion and health pick up drops, though
              the pick up will actually avoid the player once his health will drop to 1 point.

            <img src="hack_proj/editor.jpg" alt="game_play" class="responsive-img modal_img">
            <p>I built the editor as it was a great way to stress test how Dijkstra's algorithm would perform with
              thousads of enemies on screen. It also allowed the player to be creative in what
              kind of level he wanted to play, whether it would be an open space location or a buolding with narrow
              hallways. Then editor also has a built-in mechanic that will save the player's level data,
              so that the players could share their levels.</p>

            <p>Initially I worked on this model as a preparation for teaching a 3D modeling class. As I continued to
              add more detail
              I realized that the model looks very authentic and it would be great if I could finish it. As a result I
              made a super battle droid that is
              completely 3D print friendly and could also be used as an in-game-engine character due to the low poly
              count. I used <i>PigArt's</i> reference
              video to create this model.

              animation and rigging. In the latest edits I added teeth and eye shaders to make the model look more
              similar to the reference creature from the
              Pokemon games.
